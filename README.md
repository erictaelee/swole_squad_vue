# swole_squad_vue_app

My first capstone project from the coding bootcamp. I used Ruby in Rails as backend and Vue.JS as frontend. I've created my own API.

Swole Squad is a fitness app that helps you build muscles tailored to your body type. 
Have you looked at a really fit person and asked yourself, 'Wow that person is really ripped! I wonder what exercise(s) they did to look like that'
You're not alone. Swole Squad has a solution for you.
Once logged in, a user can select a trainer that resembles your body type. Just because John gained 200lbs of muscles by doing pushups, doesn't mean you will have the same result. Our body is unique and have different muscle composition.
The exercises are divided by each muscle group so a user can save the exercise then check the saved list. They are linked to the video.


Future Functions to add:
- Add meal prep functions
- Create a dashboard for the users and log workouts 
- Rate trainers
- Search trainers by location
